# GIF2SVG
## Windows Console App for converting .gif files to animated .svg files 
# 
This project is quite simple and narrow in scope, a simple windows console application which when provided with 1 or more .gif files will generate animated .svg files synced up to the .gif's frames, and extract said frames for you.
This is accomplished with C# and FFmpeg and was done in the most basic of ways
